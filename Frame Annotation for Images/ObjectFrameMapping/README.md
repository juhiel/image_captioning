The driver function in mapping.ipynb takes in two JSON files--one with the detected objects from the object detection algorithm and the other from the output of Sling. Both should be mapped to the image ID. The method outputs a dictionary mapping appropriate caption words with its frame as well as the bounding box coordinates, which is used to visualize the output. 
The code was run with the two JSON files in the 'test_resources' folder.
